      <p id="about-me">
      Born and raised in the Chicago area. I received my degree in Geology from Southern Illinois University
                        Carbondale, but ended up working in the
                        transportation industry for 16 years after taking over the family business. 
                        We unfortunately had to close due to covid and never recovered. I am currently enrolled in
                        Northwestern Full Stack Coding Boot Camp.
                        Upon graduation, I am excited to transition to become a web developer.
                        I enjoy hiking, fishing, love dogs and kittens, am addicted to good coffee, and am a hardcore
                        Star Wars fan and autograph collector.</p>
